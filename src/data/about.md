# Intro

I'm Jewelson Samuel Kingsley, a Senior Developer with over 8 years of experience in building scalable, high-performance applications. My expertise spans .NET Core, C#, React, Azure, AWS, and SQL, with a strong foundation in OOP, SOLID principles, and design patterns.

Currently, I work at Wipro Technologies in Bromley, UK, where I design and implement cloud-based solutions, modernize legacy systems, and develop enterprise-level software for industries such as finance, insurance, and energy. My experience includes transforming SOAP-based services into RESTful APIs, automating CI/CD pipelines, and enhancing real-time communication using Azure Service Bus and AWS SQS/SNS.

With a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from Manchester Metropolitan University, I bring a data-driven approach to software development, having worked on NLP applications, machine learning models, and data visualization. My passion for clean, maintainable code is reflected in my use of TDD, BDD, and automated testing methodologies.

Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring teams, collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders, and contributing to Agile development. If you're looking for someone who can architect scalable solutions, optimize performance, and deliver impactful software, let's connect!

# Some History

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2005 when I was 13. It was an old Box that ran MS-XP. My favorite games were Road Rash, NFS Hot persuit, and Dave. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.
- In the same year I started going for Cornet(trumpet like instrument) practices in my church band.
- I had been a kid who practiced serial/parallel bulb connection at home then become a reason for the powcut at my house for using the live socket instead of Batteries. 
- I subscribed to Yahoo as my first email in 2006. I still remember having the same username and password(almost similar) to most of the other email providers like gmail, hotmail.
- In the summer of 2006, I began helping my mom by documenting the finances my mom's paramedical institution and made them digital by saving a copy on disk space.
- Being more into computer actually attracted me to study computer science in my last two years of school and that's the year 2007 I started my baby steps on programming languages c and c++.
- In the same year 2007 I have eventually started makeing my hands dirty with HTML and started publishing blogspot pages and making my own code work in part of the pages by embedded my own custom HTMLs.
- In my last year of school I have created a window application which gives you the GamePassCode works as key to install the game. I have developed it as I purchased a game having 10 acivation keys in a TXT file and I made profit out of it.
